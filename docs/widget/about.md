# General introduction to Widget

---

### Concepts & subgroups

An app can contain one or more features (Super App). Whether simple or complex, self-developing an element can be time-consuming and costly.

To solve this problem, Appfast has built-in a large number of features and packaged them into separate modules called Widgets, giving you the ability to add them to your app easily. By combining **Widgets**, you can do almost anything you want.

**Widgets** are classified into **five groups**:

- **Navigation:** Take care of moving back and forth between screens.
- **Content:** Used to display content such as news, images, videos, music,...
- **E-Commerce:** Support the exchange, purchase, and sale of goods online.
- **UI Element:** Acts as a backend component in the user interface.
- **Social:** Use for features of social networks.

### Interacting with Widgetsâ€‹

You can add a new widget to the home screen by pressing the **(+)** button (Add widget) -> Select the widget you want to add to the application.

Options to change the interface, color, text, or enable/disable widget elements are located in the **Setting** column (right). Copying and pasting properties of one widget onto another, duplicating, renaming, or deleting widgets are also in this section. You can also drag and drop Widgets to change their position.
