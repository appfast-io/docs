Welcome! Do you have a business idea? Do you want to create your own mobile application without knowing how to code?

Don't worry! **AppFast** will help you do that easily.

Here are 6 steps to create a complete mobile application with **AppFast** without having to know programming:

## Step 1. Sign up & Sign in

Check out the [Sign up & Sign in](signup-signin) page to see how to sign up and sign in.

## Step 2. Come up with a business idea for your mobile application

Once you have logged in, it's time to show off your ideas for a mobile app. To create an effective application, we would like to suggest a few key points:

- First, think about your customers, they are the people who directly use the application. Therefore, asking questions from the user's perspective will help you understand customer needs better.
- Second, start with the questions: *Who is the audience your application needs to serve? What do they need? What will they do with the app? Are they easy to pay? Is interacting with the support channel convenient and quick?...*
- Third, as a business creator, *what products and services will you provide? What kind of app should you have? What is its interface like? Style of the app? How convenient is it for customers to use?...*

## Step 3. Choose your desired app template or design your own interface from scratch

Now, it's time to put your idea into practical use. Take a look at the [Create/Edit App](create-edit-app) article to see how to create your app from a template or design your own interface from scratch. You can also edit your existing app from the dashboard.

Typically, *your app URL will have the following format: `<https://dash.appfast.io/studio/yourAppId/design>`*.

## Step 4. Design and tweak the app as you like

After creating the application, you will be redirected to the **AppFast** builder. On this builder, you will have all powerful tools to edit the app user interface (UI) as desired. You can also manage your plugins and settings on the **AppFast** builder.

Take a look at the [Design Tab](design-tab) article to familiarize yourself with the main sections of the builder and learn more about what you can do inside of **AppFast**.

## Step 5. Preview and internal testing

You can preview your app while building in **AppFast**. In preview mode, you can test your app interactions before publishing it to the live environment.

## Step 6. Publish your app to live on the internet or on app stores for your customers

In this last step, you can publish your app to Web, Apple App Store (iOS) or Google App Store (Android) for your customers.
