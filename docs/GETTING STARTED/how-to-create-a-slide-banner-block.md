---

The Slide Banner block is a versatile and visually engaging element that allows you to display multiple images or
content slides within a single banner. This guide will walk you through the steps to create and customize a Slide Banner
block using the common block properties available in Appfast.

## Understanding the Slide Banner Block

The Slide Banner block is designed to showcase a series of slides, typically images or promotional content, in a
rotating banner format. This block is commonly used on homepages or landing pages to capture user attention and
highlight important messages or offers.

## Adding a Slide Banner Block

### Step 1: Navigate to the Block Section

To add a Slide Banner block, navigate to the section of your page where you want the banner to appear. Click on the Add
Block button, and from the available block options, select Slide Banner.

Once the block is added, you can start configuring the slides:

- Add New Slide: Click on **Add item** (5) to include a new slide in the banner.
- Content:
    - Each slide can include an image, text, or a combination of both. You can upload images or use existing ones from
      your media library (3).
    - Each slide can be linked (4) to a screen, an URL, a project, or even perform an action in the app. You can also
      set it to No-Link to not link to anywhere (2).
- Slide Order: Arrange the slides in the desired order by dragging and dropping them within the block settings (1).

## Customizing the Block Properties

The Slide Banner block comes with several customizable properties that allow you to tailor its appearance to match your
design needs. Here’s a quick overview of the common block properties:

### Common Block Properties:

### Best Practices for Using Slide Banners

- **Limit the Number of Slides:** While it might be tempting to include many slides, keeping the number of slides to a
  minimum ensures that users focus on the key messages.
- **Use High-Quality Images:** Ensure that the images used in your slides are of high quality and optimized for fast
  loading times.
- **Clear Call-to-Actions:** Each slide should have a clear call-to-action (CTA) to guide users on what to do next,
  whether it’s clicking a link, signing up for a newsletter, or exploring more content.

By following these steps, you can create a compelling and effective Slide Banner block that enhances the visual appeal
of your website while delivering key messages to your audience.
