# General introduction to Block

---

### Concepts & subgroups

An app can contain one or more features (Super App). Whether simple or complex, self-developing an element can be time-consuming and costly.

To solve this problem, Appfast has built-in a large number of features and packaged them into separate modules called blocks, giving you the ability to add them to your app easily. By combining **blocks**, you can do almost anything you want.

**blocks** are classified into **five groups**:

- **Navigation:** Take care of moving back and forth between screens.
- **Content:** Used to display content such as news, images, videos, music,...
- **E-Commerce:** Support the exchange, purchase, and sale of goods online.
- **UI Element:** Acts as a backend component in the user interface.
- **Social:** Use for features of social networks.

### Interacting with Blocksâ€‹

You can add a new block to the home screen by pressing the **(+)** button (Add block) -> Select the block you want to add to the application.

Options to change the interface, color, text, or enable/disable block elements are located in the **Setting** column (right). Copying and pasting properties of one block onto another, duplicating, renaming, or deleting blocks are also in this section. You can also drag and drop blocks to change their position.
