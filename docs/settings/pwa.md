# How to use PWA
---
First, ensure you've filled in all the necessary information before publishing your app.

PWA (Progressive Web Apps) publishing allows you to use the application directly through the browser without installation like traditional application publishing methods. No more cumbersome setup operations. Now your job is to change the access address (if needed).

In the **"Setting"** tab -> Select **PWA Domain**-> **Default PWA domain** -> Enter domain name -> Select **"Edit PWA Domain"**

### In case you want Custom Domainâ€‹
In tab **"Setting"** -> Select **PWA Domain** -> **Mapping Custom Domain** -> Enter domain name / Custom Domain -> Select **"Verify custom domain"**

Done, now you can access the address just set up above and start using this application right in the browser.
