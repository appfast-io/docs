# General introduction about Design

### Interact with the screen

Screens can be considered the "back bone" of an app because they act as containers, helping to hold and structure the smaller components inside. With Appfast, you need to take care of the following two types of screens: **Screens created by you** and **Plugin screens** (screens that the system automatically generates after you install a plugin).

### Here's what you can do with the display:

- Add a new screen.

- Drag and drop to change the screen position.

:::tip

The project's main screen will be labeled **"Home screen"** in the **Action** tab on the right, and Appfast defaults to the first screen appearing in the list will be the main screen.

:::

- Copy and paste properties of one screen onto another, duplicate, rename, or delete screens

:::caution

You cannot perform add, delete, copy, paste, duplicate, or rename operations for Plugin screens. But you can config the design color.

### Screen Settings​

The settings of the monitor (and nearly all other components) are usually placed in the right corner (circled in red). This is where you can change icon properties and color or enable/disable some screen constraints. Try changing them to personalize the screen to your style.

:::caution

The **Background**image has a higher priority than the **Background** color, so if both properties are set, the **Background** image will have a preference to display.

### Interacting with blocks​

There are two ways to add the block in the place where it needs to be added:
- On each screen, select **“+”** under existing blocks.
- At the application interface screen, select **“+”** under existing blocks.

There are two ways to edit blocks:
- The block customization screen will be on the right in each block selection screen to edit.
- In the application interface screen, select the block to be edited. The block customization screen will be on the right.
