# General introduce about Design

### Interact with the screen

Screens can be considered the "backbone" of an app because they act as containers, helping to hold and structure the smaller components inside. With Appfast, you need to take care of the following 2 types of screens: **Screens created by you** and **built-in system monitors**.

### Here's what you can do with the display:

- Add a new screen.

- Drag and drop to change the screen position.

:::tip

The main screen of the project will be labeled **"Home screen"** in the **Action** tab on the right, and Appfast defaults to the first screen appearing in the list will be the main screen.

:::

- Copy and paste properties of one screen onto another, duplicate, rename, or delete screens

:::caution

You cannot perform add, delete, copy, paste, duplicate, rename operations for system monitors. You also cannot change their position.

### Screen Settings​

The settings of the monitor (and nearly all other components) are usually placed in the right corner (circled in red). This is where you can change icon properties, color, or enable/disable some screen constraints. Try changing them to personalize the screen to your style.

:::caution

**Background** image has higher priority than **Background color**, so in case both properties are set, **Background** image will have priority to display.

### Interacting with widgets​

There are 2 ways to add the widget, in the place where it needs to be added:
- In each screen select **“+”** under existing widgets.
- At the application interface screen select **“+”** under existing widgets.

There are 2 ways to edit widgets:
- In each widget selection screen to edit, the widget customization screen will be on the right.
- In the application interface screen, select the widget to be edited, the widget customization screen will be on the right.
