**>>** the system will automatically sign you in.

### Step 2. Come up with a business idea for your mobile application.

Once you have logged in, it's time to show off your ideas for a mobile app. To create an effective application, we would like to suggest a few key points:

- First, think about your customers, they are the people who directly use the application. Therefore, asking questions from the user's perspective will help you understand customer needs better.
- Second, start with the questions: Who is the audience your application needs to serve? What do they need? What will they do with the app? Are they easy to pay? Is interacting with the support channel convenient and quick? ...
- Third, as a business creator, what products and services will you provide? What kind of app should you have? What is its interface like? Style of the app? How convenient is it for customers to use? ...

### Step 3. Choose your desired app template or design your own interface from scratch.

Once you've completed **Step 2**, it's time to put your idea into practical use. You will have a starting interface with a default app as follows:
_(Your app URLs will have the following format: https://dash.appfast.io/studio/yourAppId/design)_

In this basic guide, we'll show you how to create your app from a template that helps you easily understand how to use these powerful tools.

### Step 4. Design and tweak the app as you like.

After creating the application in Step 3. The system will redirect you to the design page by default. On this screen, you will have tools to edit the application's user interface (UI) as desired. We will have a design screen with the following interface and functions:
![DesignScreen.jpeg](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7lukjvw9fms1zh181j7qw/DesignScreen.jpeg?rlkey=xihduosagsiompb5gv88rlnob&dl=0&raw=1)

- 1. Current screen (Men's screen) of the app (red rectangle areas).
     This screen tells you it has 12 blocks. The position and order of blocks in the screen are as in section 1.1 - 1.1 Screen appearance displayed on mobile devices.
     The design function will allow you to preview the layout and design of your app to give you an overview. From there, it will help you improve the design and more suitable for your needs. If you want detailed settings, please see the sections in 1.2. - 1.2 Custom settings for the current screen.
     These are option settings that you can do with the screen. Screens will sometimes have their own special options. You can change color, size, font style, font size, background... Express your ideas the way you want.
- 2. Block of current screen (blue rectangle areas).
     It is one of the 12 blocks of the current screen. When you select it, the layout section in 2.1 will automatically scroll to its position in the Men's screen for you. - 2.1 Layout and location of the block.
     You can optionally change the layout of the design by selecting the block in **section 1** (the left), and selecting the "**Move up, Move down**" button in **section 2.1** (the middle) to a desirable location. - 2.2 Block settings.
     These are the optional settings for the block you selected in section 2. Similar to 1.2, you can customize it to your style.
- 3. Add more blocks for the current screen (green rectangle areas).
     When you need to add a new block to the screen, select "**Add block**" and "**Name**" it. The new block will be added to the bottom of the current screen, select it and "**Move**" to the desired location. - 3.1 Layout and interface of the new block.
     This is where the New block will be added, scroll down > select it > move up. - 3.2 New block settings may have.
     Similar to 1.2 and 2.2, you select the block in sections 1 or 2 or 3 (on the left), and its corresponding option settings will be available (on the right) for you. Customize it to your best satisfaction.

### Step 5. Preview and internal testing.

Once you've completed the desired edits in **"Step 4."**, it's time to **"Preview"** and test your app's interactions before publishing it to the live environment.
