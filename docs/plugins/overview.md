### What is "Plugin" ?

With Appfast, the application's data and features are divided into separate **"Plugins"** for easy management by users.

When you need to use a feature, you just need to go to the **"Plugin"** tab and select and install that feature to use.

In the design interface, the **"Plugin"** tab displays a list of the plugins you install and the pages that come with the **"Plugin"** -> You can customize the interface for the accompanying pages here.
