* Go to the *REST API* tab and click *Add key*.
* Give the key a description for your own reference, choose a user with access to orders etc, and give the key *read/write* permissions.
* Click *Generate api key*.
* Your keys will be shown – do not close this tab yet, the secret will be hidden if you try to view the key again.
